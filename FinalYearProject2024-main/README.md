<h1> Crypto-Tool : A Comprehensive Platform for Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptographic Algorithms </h1>

This is a Stand-Alone Java Application that can Encrypt and Decrypt plain text and files of a user on thier systems.<br>
This Tool contains Symmetric Cryptographic Algorithms as Caesar Cipher, Modified Caesar Cipher, AES (256 bits key).<br>
This Tool Contains Asymmetric Cryptographic Algorithm as RSA (2048 bits key).<br>
This Tool Contains our team's two new designed symmetric algorithms named as Arithmatic No Key Algorithm and Bit Manipulation Fixed Key Algorithm respectively.<br>
