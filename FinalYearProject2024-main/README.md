<h1> Crypto-Tool : A Comprehensive Platform for Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptographic Algorithms </h1>

This is a Stand-Alone Java Application that can Encrypt and Decrypt plain text and files of a user on thier systems.
This Tool contains Symmetric CryptoGraphy Algorithms as Caesar Cipher, Modified Caesar Cipher, AES (256 bits key) .
This Tool Contains Asymmetric CryptoGraphy Algorithm as RSA (2048 bits key).
This Tool Contains our team's two new symmetric algorithms named as Arithmatic No Key Algorithm and Bit Manipulation Fixed Key Algorithm.
