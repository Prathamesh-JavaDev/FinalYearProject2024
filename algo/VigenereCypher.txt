The vigenere cipher is an algorithm that is used to 
encrypting and decrypting the text.
 The vigenere cipher is an algorithm of encrypting
 an alphabetic text that uses a series of interwoven
 caesar ciphers. It is based on a keyword's letters.
 It is an example of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. 
This algorithm is easy to understand and implement. 
This algorithm was first described in 1553 by Giovan
 Battista Bellaso. It uses a Vigenere table or Vigenere
 square for encryption and decryption of the text. 
The vigenere table is also called the tabula recta.
To decrypt a message, you reverse the process by
 first finding the row that corresponds to the current
 letter in the key, then looking along that row until
 you find the corresponding letter in the ciphertext. 
The letter at the top of this column is the plaintext letter.
