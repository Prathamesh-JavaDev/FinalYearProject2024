We all know in Caesar cipher we replace each alphabet
 with other alphabet which is 3 positions down the order. 
Modified Caesar cipher is same as actual Caesar cipher 
with little modification.
We are now saying that alphabet A will not necessarily
 replace by alphabet D. It can be replaced by any other
 valid alphabet i.e. by E,F,G and so on, there are 25 other
 alphabets with whom we can replace alphabet A.
 Once replacement scheme is decided then it would be
 constant and will be use to replace other alphabets in
 that message.
There are only 25 other combinations because there are
 26 alphabets in English and it doesnâ€™t make sense to 
replace it with himself.
Hence to break modified Caesar cipher our earlier algorithm
would not work but it is still weak encryption method.
Caesar cipher modification is done by replacing the alphabet
 into two parts, the vocals were replaced with the alphabet 
vocal too,and the consonant alphabet was replaced with a
 consonantal alphabet.
